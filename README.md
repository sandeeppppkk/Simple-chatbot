# Simple-chatbot
A simple rule-based chatbot written in Python. It interacts with the user based on predefined inputs and provides friendly responses using conditional statements.

📌 Features
Responds to basic greetings and common phrases.

Keeps chatting in a loop until the user types "bye".

Simple and easy to understand logic using:
if-elif-else conditions
functions
loops
input() and print()


🧑‍💻 How It Works
The chatbot greets the user and waits for input.
It checks the user's input against known phrases
If the input matches, it gives a predefined response.
If the input is "bye", the chatbot exits.
If the input is unknown, it replies with a default message.
